# Orion
Orion is a virtual assistant software application developed by Atharv Tripathi. Based on artificial intelligence, Orion can engage in two-way conversations.
Main objective of building personal assistant software (a virtual assistant) is using semantic data sources available on the web, user generated content and providing knowledge from knowledge databases. The main purpose of an intelligent virtual assistant is to answer questions that users may have. This may be done in a business environment, for example, on the business website, with a chat interface. On the mobile platform, the intelligent virtual assistant is available as a call-button operated service where a voice asks the user “What can I do for you?” and then responds to verbal input. 



Virtual assistants can tremendously save you time. We spend hours on online research and then making the report in our terms of understanding. ORION can do that for you. Provide a topic for research and continue with your tasks while ORION does the research. Another difficult task is to remember test dates, birthdates or anniversaries. It comes as a surprise when you enter the class and realize it is a class test today. Just tell ORION in advance about your tests and he will remind you well in advance so you can prepare for the test. 



One of the main advantages of voice searches is their rapidity. In fact, voice is reputed to be four times faster than a written search: whereas we can write about 40 words per minute, we are capable of speaking around 150 during the same period of time. In this respect, the ability of personal assistants to accurately recognize spoken words is a prerequisite for them to be adopted by consumers.
